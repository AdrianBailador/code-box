## Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build server-rendered applications. It is a complete full-stack framework that allows you to build web applications with React.js. It is a powerful tool that allows you to build web applications with ease.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website [here](https://nodejs.org/).
Also, you should know the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js.
And the last but not the least, you should have a code editor installed on your machine. I recommend using Visual Studio Code. You can download Visual Studio Code from the official website [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Creating a Next.js App

To create a Next.js app, you can use the following command:

```bash 
npx npx create-next-app@latest
```

This command will create a new Next.js app in the current directory.

See the next image for the output of the command:
